# John Sullivan's Resume

This repository houses my resume and may be useful to those wishing to create a similar resume.

If you are looking for more information on me, you should check out my portfolio at [johnsullivan.name](http://johnsullivan.name).

## Use as a Template

You are free to use my resume as a template if you'd like. If you wish to use my resume for any other purpose (using it as an example, distributing paper copies, etc), please ask me. My contact information is in [my portfolio](http://johnsullivan.name).

## Setting up git

`git` doesn't know how to diff `.odt` files by default. To fix this, install the [odt2txt](http://stosberg.net/odt2txt/) program (it's probably available in one of your distribution's default package repositories) then run `git config diff.odt.textconv odt2txt` in the root directory of the repo.
