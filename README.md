# Resume & Portfolio

This repository houses my resume & portfolio hybrid and may be useful to those wishing to create a similar thing.

I made this so that I didn't have to maintain a portfolio and a resume separately. Both had gotten very out of date over time (to different degrees), and had enough traffic to make me feel bad about it.

Unlike my [personal site](https://github.com/itsjohncs/johncs.com) which has an absurdly complicated (and amusing) build process, my resume & portfolio is just a simple HTML file I smash a bunch of stuff into.

You're welcome to try and use this as a template if you'd like (though I didn't really attempt to create particularly clean code).
