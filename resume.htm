			I improved on the DNS cache used by Firefox, Firefox OS, and other mozilla products. It now uses TTL information when available. This involved writing platform specific code for most of Gecko's targeted platforms. I also worked on allowing a mesh network to be established through Firefox OS phones.

			I improved Khan Academy's search page by radically updating its UI; moving our backing engine from self-hosted Solr to a more easily-scalable CloudSearch; implementing a search-as-you-type feature (which was possible due to our stronger engine); reducing the time it takes to update our search index from hours to a couple minutes; and tons more.

			In my first internship, I was solely responsible for designing and implementing a new closed captioning system for their set top boxes (CEA-608). My code proved to be very stable and few bug reports were filed against our closed caption system during my year-long-absence.
			During my second internship, as the need to support other caption formats emerged (we were entering markets in other countries), I created a stable platform that the rest of our developers could build atop while helping with the effort to support CEA-708.
